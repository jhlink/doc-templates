# Design Proposal Template

### Author: [you@](mailto:you@domain.example)

## Objective 

_One or two sentence description of what you problem you are trying to solve._

## Goals

_List of things your design explicitly tries to accomplish. The design must meet all of these to be acceptable._

* 
* 

## Non-goals

_List of things your design explicitly chooses to not address._

* 
* 

## Background

_Describe any systems, components, and/or technologies which are required for
but are not part of this design proposal. Assume your audience is unfamiliar
with the design space. Only provide as much detail here as necessary for a
reader to make sense of your design proposal and know where to look if they
want additional detail. Include links to relevant references both internal
and external._

_This is also the place to discuss the limitations of prior designs and
implementations. Wait to describe your solutions to those limitations as part
of the Proposal section._

## Proposal

_Describe your design in terms of what you covered in the Background section.
Provide an overview of the major components in your proposed solution, how
users and external components will interact with them, and how the components
interact with each other internally._

_Ideally, your proposal only covers an approach to solving the problem
outlined in the Objective, not the implementation details._


## Alternatives Considered

_For each major design choice in your proposal, add a subsection here to
describe each alternative you considered and why you rejected it. A reader
should be able to understand your reasoning that led to your proposal even if
they disagree._
